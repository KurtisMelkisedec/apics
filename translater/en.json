A business rule is a statement or parameter that defines or constrains some aspect of the business and is generally used in decision making. Business rules are intended to influence the outcomes of operating the supply chain. Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals while maintaining compliance to internal and external policies and laws. An example business rule may state 'no returns accepted without a return authorization'. Types of supply chain business rules include: Performance goals Rules to ensure or enforce compliance to regulations and policies (e.g. ITAR), Planning rules such as frequency, horizon and level of plans, planning BOMs",
      "sE2": "The process of defining performance targets for supply chain metrics that align to overall business strategy and goals, and for reporting performance, identifying gaps in performance, performing root cause analysis, and developing and launching corrective actions to close gaps in performance. This process describes all levels and versions of managing supply chain performance. Examples include: Inventory Cycle Counting, Inventory optimization projects, Order cycle time reduction efforts, Production and process quality improvement programs, Supplier performance Assessments Process and practice maturity assessments Note: It is common for organizations to have multiple versions of this process in place, in different parts of the organization. At level-3 and 4, these processes may differ significantly depending on the objectives of each of these manage performance processes.",
      "sE3": "The process of collecting, maintaining and publishing data and information required to plan, operate, measure and manage the supply chain. Examples of data element categories include: Master Data: Foundational data on customers, suppliers, raw materials, BOMs, recipes, products, people, processes, and assets needed to operate the supply chain; Transactional Data: Data associated with purchasing, receiving, material movements, value add operations, stocking, picking, packing, shipping, and delivery of materials and products; Collaboration Data: Data from supply chain partners the provides the cross-organization supply chain visibility required to plan and execute the supply chain in an integrated end-to-end manner; Meta Data: Data that describes and adds information about other data; Performance Data: Metrics data and the associated raw input data needed to calculate metrics; Other: Sensor / Internet of Things (loT) data, social network data Activities include adding, changing and deleting (archiving) information, maintaining user access (grant, revoke) and maintaining availability of the information (activate/ deactivate).",
      "sE4": "The process of developing, governing and maintaining an organization of permanent, temporary and outsourced staff, with the right qualifications, in support of the business objects and supply chain goals. This includes identifying required and available skills in the organization, determining gaps in skills and Competency levels, identifying training needs, resource gaps and excess resources. Note: This is a planning process to ensure staff (capacity) is available at the right levels. The actual training, hiring and redeployment is not part of this process as those are HR processes.",
      "sE5": "The process of scheduling, maintaining and dispositioning of supply chain assets developed for supply chain execution. This includes installation, repair, alteration, calibration and other activities necessary to sustain supply chain execution. Discussion: This is more of a scheduling process to ensure assets (capacity) is available at the right levels at the right time. The actual maintenance, etc. processes are described using standard SCOR processes. For example: The process to perform routine maintenance on a truck is describe using Return MRO and/or Make processes.",

This includes all agreements related to supply chain operations, including: material and services acquisition, inventory stocking practices and levels, performance targets, planning and decision making, logistics and delivery, and data exchange and visibility. Notes: This covers former sES. 10 and parts of sES.6, sEM.6, SED.6, sER.6. The identification and selection of suppliers and contract negotiations reside in DCOR processes (and partially in sS3). Customer pursuit and closing customer contracts reside in CCOR processes.",

      "sE8": "The process of identifying, collecting, assessing and integrating regulatory compliance requirements in standard supply chain processes, policies and business rules. This process also includes managing voluntary compliance to standards and certifications. Regulatory Compliance is the term generally used to describe the policies and processes which organizations have in place to ensure that they comply with laws, rules and regulations put in place by external bodies (government) which control activity in a given jurisdiction. Often, organizations choose to go beyond regulatory compliance to meet voluntary compliance standards and/or pursue voluntary certifications for strategic reasons. Voluntary compliance to standards and certifications examples includes: ISO standards, and optional certifications such as Rain Forest Alliance Certified, Sustainable Forestry Initiative, etc. A key component of Regulatory/Voluntary Compliance is establishing policies, business rules and processes to ensure legislative and regulatory compliance requirements are met. This includes ensuring personnel are aware of and take steps to comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards, and the data or records retention used for compliance validation. Regulatory Compliance examples include: C-TPAT, Hazardous Materials, Import/Export, Labor, Licensing, Taxes. Note: These are examples, SCOR does not (attempt to) provide a complete list.",
      "sE9": "The process of identification and assessment of potential disruptions (risks) in the supply chain and developing a plan to mitigate these threats to operating the supply chain. Supply chain risks include: Disruptions in demand - e.g. customers going out of business, Disruptions in supply - e.g. suppliers going out of business, supplier quality/performance issues, Environmental disruptions -e.g. weather, flooding, earthquakes, Financial disruptions - e.g. availability of credit, investors, Fraud, theft and mismanagement - lack of risk mitigation, Labor disruption - e.g. employee strikes, availability of qualified staff, Terrorism and cyber Attacks Risk mitigation strategies include avoiding the risk, reducing the impact or probability of the risk, transferring the risk to another party and accepting part of the risk. Example changes to the supply chain network, process and resources include: insurance, relocation, dual/triple sourcing, outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring, reshoring, security, supply chain redesign, process redesign, business rule changes, contract renegotiation. SE9 Manage Supply Chain Risk is closely aligned with section 5 of the ISO 31000 standard. ISO 31000 is a generic risk management standard across the enterprise, sE9 - Manage Supply Chain Risk is the adaptation for supply chain risk management. Note: ISO 31000 section 5.6 Monitor and Review is represented in SCOR as sE2 Manage",

The Scope of technology enablement in the supply chain goes well beyond foundations ERP and MRP systems to include: Planning systems, Supplier portals, Sourcing tools and platforms, Manufacturing execution systems (MES), Supply chain modeling and analytics tools, Sensors and Internet of Things (loT) solutions, Process and activity automation solutions, Supply chain visibility and collaboration tools and platforms, Supply chain risk monitoring and management tools and platforms Metrics and reporting tools, Demands sensing technologies (e.g. social network monitoring and analysis) Discussion: Many organizations have enterprise-wide processes for managing technology. This process is not intended to duplicate or replace those enterprise processes, but is intended to reinforce the need for focused attention and participation of the supply chain organization in the definition of requirements and technology choices for the supply chain. It does not include the standard IT management activities for testing and implementation of new technology solutions."
